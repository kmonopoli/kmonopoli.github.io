title: Kathryn Monopoli
description: I am a second year Ph.D. student studying Bioinformatics at UMass Medical School and Worcester Polytechnic Institute. I am advised by Anastasia Khvorova and Dmitry Korkin. I am interested in developing methods to bridge biology, computer science, and data science. My broad research goals are to expand the application of advance computational methods in the biological realm to build our general understanding of biology and to develop therapeutics. My primary focus is on applying machine learning techniques to enhance our understanding of the small interfering RNA gene silencing mechanism. I am passionate about increasing access of computational tools to biologists through developing easy-to-use computational tools that do not require any coding knowledge. I conducted my undergraduate studies at the Colorado School of Mines and the University of Massachusetts Amherst where I completed my BS summa cum laude. I completed my MS in the Laboratory of Alejandro Heuck at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I transitioned from bench work where I conducted biophysical assays to assess membrane protein structure to computational research studying small interfering RNAs.
